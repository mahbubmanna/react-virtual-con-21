## Project Overview

This site is created for React Virtual Con'21 Organisers and Interested Audience.

* The organizers and audiences can know about the potential speakers of the conference. Their profiles are mentioned precisely on the website.

* Visitors will see the topics of each speaker's talk. That may help the organizers to attract more Audiences.

* A special feature is added for organizers to choose the best speakers within their budget. Anyone can choose some speakers with the <Choose as Speaker> button and can calculate the total potential audience.
